# Fortnite Lego AFK XP

Recently, the developers at EPIC have made it so a user can no longer earn XP in Lego Fortnite if they're AFK. Previously, players had to sleep in a bed and enjoy the free XP. However, the recent update requires users to play the game to gain XP. This is where this script comes into play; it simulates a user playing the game by infinitely moving them for a random time.

## Pre-Requirements
Once the files have been installed, open a terminal within the directory and run the following command to install the pre-required packages to move the player and generate progress bars.
```bash
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
```

## Usage/Examples
Once the required packages are installed and in-game, you can run the script in your terminal and click on the game to begin the process.

```bash
python main.py
```


## FAQ

#### It doesn't work while I'm trying to do other things!

Since this is a script that uses your keyboard and mouse, you won't be able to do other things on your computer while the program is running. However, you can stop the program by stopping the script or closing the terminal.

#### Do you have any other scripts to aid in XP?

Yes, I have a script for Fortnite Festival, working similarly randomly. It can be found here or from my GitHub profile:
